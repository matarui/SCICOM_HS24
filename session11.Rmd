### Here are a few questions about 2050! What do you think?

- Will we still need pluralistic explanations?

- Will our models of intelligence involve *g*? 

- Will we think of the mind as a collection of modules?

- Will we make a distinction between cognition and emotion?

- Will machines have consciousness?

- Will behavioral research still be needed?
