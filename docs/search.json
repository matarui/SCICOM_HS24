A FAQ forum is available on ADAM.\nGrading\nThe final grade for the course will be based on two components:\nTheory (40%): This portion will be evaluated through an exam designed to test your understanding of core concepts covered in lectures and readings.\nAssignments (60%): The majority of the grade will come from practical assignments, which involve applying the principles learned to specific applications. Timely submission and the quality of work will be key factors in this component.\nRecommended reading\nVisualizing Complexity: Modular Information Design Handbook by Darjan Hill and Nicole Lachenmeier.\n\n\n\n",
